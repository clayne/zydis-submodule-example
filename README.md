Zydis as a CMake subdirectory
=============================

## Regular / User Mode Apps

If you plan on building a user mode app (that is, a regular app that runs
on e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux, ...), please refer to the `usermode` directory
in this repo.

## Windows Kernel

For Windows kernel drivers, please take a look at the `win-kernel` directory.
Other than the Windows kernel example in the Zydis repo which uses a
Visual Studio project, this examples makes use of `INSERT LIB NAME HERE`
and CMake.
